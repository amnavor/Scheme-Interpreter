# Scheme-Interpreter

Synopsis
------------
This is a Scheme Interpreter, incorporating parsing and a Read-Eval-Print
loop.  The parser/reader is scheme_reader.py; the evaluator is scheme.py.
Note that scheme.py also included code for special forms, such a conditional
and lambda functions. The tests we created are in tests.scm, although staff
tests are not included.  Some questions provided by staff and answered by 
ourselves are included in questions.scm.

This file is written in Python. This project was a group effort between 
myself and my friend Erica Huey for the UC Berkeley CS61A course; 
therefore, staff files like tests and GUI are not included.
